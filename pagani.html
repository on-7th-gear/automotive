    <p>Pagani Automobili S.p.A. is an Italian manufacturer of sports cars and carbon fibre. The company was founded in 1992 by the Argentinian Horacio Pagani, and is based in San Cesario sul Panaro, near Modena, Italy. </p>

    <p>Pagani has a childlike enthusiasm for his art that is impossible to ignore. His progression from a baker's son in Argentina to a smart young engineer seeking his fortune in Italy.</p>

    <p>Pagani is busy building the Huayra super sports car. A car so special and with a price so high that only a handful of the richest (and very lucky) people in the world will ever drive. Before that the factory was busy churning out the Pagani Zonda, his first supercar, a classic.</p>
