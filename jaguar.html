    <p>In 1950 Jaguar agreed to lease the Daimler Shadow 2 factory from the Ministry of Supply. They were still supplying raw materials to companies at this point, as it wasn’t too long after the Second World War.Jaguar then purchased Daimler in 1960 from BSA. Jaguar used the Daimler marque as a brand name for their most luxurious saloons throughout the late 1960s. This is not to be confused with the Daimler brand.</p>
