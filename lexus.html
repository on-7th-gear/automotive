    <p>Since Lexus arrived on the world stage in 1989, we have constantly developed our business. Having started with just two models sold exclusively in the USA, we have steadily expanded both our product range and our global reach.

Even within a year from our launch, we established a presence in 17 different countries, including in Europe, while today the number is more than 90, making us a luxury brand with genuine international recognition.

The expansion continues today, not just in the automotive world, but taking our commitment to luxury, creativity and innovation into many different fields, from film and product design to ocean going yachts and amazing lifestyle experiences.</p>

    <p>Without the support of Akio Toyoda, President and Member of the Board of the Toyota Motor Corporation, the legendary Lexus LFA supercar may never have been built. Approached for support in 2002 by the vehicle’s creators, Chief Engineer Haruhiko Tanahashi and the late master driver Hiromu Naruse, Toyoda-san quickly became the LFA’s primary champion.</p>
